Mapping the entire 5 Clicks to Hitler game with the Wikipedia API


The goal here is to input a wikipedia page ID or page title and return all link paths to the Adolf Hitler page of length 5 or less.

This is based on the [5 clicks to Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game) game.
